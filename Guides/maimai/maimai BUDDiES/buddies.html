            <h2>Prerequisites and important information:</h2>
            <p>Please ensure you have the following:</p>
            <p>WinRAR - To extract the game</p>
            <p>(Optional) Notepad ++ - To route directory paths and configure the game. Default notepad can be used.</p>
            <p>Disclaimer: Do not release any of this data publically due to piracy issues and the risk of SEGA going after us.<p>
            <p>Installation of maimai DX on a maimai FiNALE Cabinet is possible but not recommended due to the difference in hardware.</p>
            <p>(Discussed in a separate page) The instructions on how to setup the COM ports are meant for maiDXR (VR maimai) and YuanCon ADX Controllers.</p>

            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>2. Extact the archive using WinRAR or 7zip.</p>
            <p>3. Upon opening the first few folders, you'll be greeted with 4 more folders and 1 zip file. Open the folder labelled "app"</p>
            <p>4. Next, open the folder labelled "package"</p>
            <p>Normally you'll need to install segatools (Software that allows the game to run) with a separate download but in this case it'll be preinstalled for you.</p>
            <p>5. Locate a file called "segatools.ini" and open it in any text editing software like notepad.</p>
            <p>6. In the first few lines, you'll need to route a few folders based on what the text asks for (amfs, options and appdata).</p>
            <p>Example of what to copy and paste - "C:\[Replace this with wherever your game's folder is located]\maimaiBUDDiES\maimaiBUDs\option".</p>
            <p>Repeat with the other two folders - "C:\[Replace this with wherever your game's folder is located]\maimaiBUDDiES\maimaiBUDs\app\Package\appdata" and "C:\[Replace this with wherever your game's folder is located]\maimaiBUDDiES\maimaiBUDs\amfs"
            <p>7. Save the edited file and locate another file called "start.bat". This will open the necessary software needed as well as the game itself.</p>
            <p>If there's a black screen, open CMD as an administrator and run the following command: "setx OPENSSL_ia32cap ~0x20000000"
            <p>You'll be greeted with a few loading screens at first so wait for the game to finish initializing. Default controls are usually "QWEADZXC" for the buttons, 1/2 for Service and Test Mode and 3 to insert credits if applicable. Player 2's controls are via the numpad. A mouse can be used to control the sliders and tap notes.</p>
            <p>If everything goes well, you'll be at the menu. However if you see a small border with text along the upper half of the circle, follow the next steps.</p>
            <p>8. Press 2 (F1 or Home key if 2 doesn't work) on your keyboard to access the service menu.</p>
            <p>9. The text will all be in Japanese but press C until you've reached the 7th option called (ゲーム設定). Press X to access it's settings.</p>
            <p>10. (Press C to scroll down and X to change a setting. Del Key or F3 alternatively) There will be 3 columns. Ensure the first is ON, second is OFF with the number below being 1 and lastly, the third column ON with the bottom number being 25%.</p>
            <p>11. Scroll to the bottom and head out of that section. Scroll to the bottom again and press X to startup the game. If done correctly you should be able to start playing!</p>
            <p>12. Finally, your game after a certain time may be locked and you cannot enter the game. This is due to an option on the game itself, and you will have to enter the debug menu. Press F1 to enter, and the C button to scroll. Select the option below the one that says "aime". Once you select that, go to where it has the numbers and select it until it has text without any numbers.</p>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
