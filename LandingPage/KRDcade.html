<p style="text-align:center;color:black;font-family:sans-serif;"> It all started not too long ago in November of 2021. I was at my best friend's house and was introduced to Osu!. I was immidiately intrigued by the gameplay and how to play it. 
<br>
As soon as I got home, I booted up my old laptop and downloaded the game. Little did I know it would start my official journey as a rhythm gamer. When I discovered 
<br>
that others had really good gameplay and played difficult maps (over 6 star), it drove me to improve and be more involved with rhythm games. Without Youtube, I wouldn't 
<br>
have discovered other rhythm games such as maimai. Cue SilverStar555 on Youtube. This channel is the reason why I know maimai and have a burning passion for it.
<br>
These videos that cover various popular rhythm game songs in many rhythm games inspired me to play maimai. On my birthday on the 8th of January 2022, I went to
<br>
Round One in Ginowan, Okinawa. Being a relatively new arcade-goer, I hadn't discovered maimai DX because I went inside the spo-cha area. In the spo-cha, they only had
<br>
maimai FiNALE, and it was offline. There was a whole wall lined with the FiNALE cabs, probably about 6-8 of them all lined up. As soon as I saw the cabs, I remembered them
<br>
from the videos SilverStar555 had made. The first play in and I was already hooked to the game. Turns out, my local GiGO (which this GiGO is the only one in Okinawa) had maimai DX. 
<br>
Super stoked, I visited the GiGO on April 19th of that year and was also immediately hooked. I felt lucky the GiGO was less than half a mile away from where I lived at the time,
<br>
so I frequented that location often. I even got the chance to play maimai with Amakage, a popular maituber twice. Once in September 2022, and April 2023. 
<br>
maimai has been an amazing rhythm game that helped me bond with my irl friends. The feeling of inspiring my friends to play was absolutely euphoric, and I hope others get to feel the same as me.
<br>
Unfortunately, we were given orders on June 11th, 2023 to leave Japan. I had to leave behind my friends, my local arcade, and every memory I had made over there. Before I had moved,
<br>
I had turned to searching for a way to play maimai FiNALE/DX at home and on a PC. Cue Emuline.org. This website also set the stage for meeting my boyfriend, my one true love, GetzeAvenue.
<br>
He has helped me in the download and setup process of maimai DX, and has also set the stage for my mission today. Ever since Emuline
shut down mysteriously, I had an old Reddit post
<br>
start exploding with replies asking how to install the game. I thought of a way to organize all the requests, and I thought, what would be a better idea than to set up a Discord server?
<br>
I had a Discord server I had made for the r/maimai Subreddit laying around from December 2022 that was never established until April 20th, 2024. KRDcade was born right here.</p>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:25px"> Mine and GetzeAvenue's Mission For Every maimai Fan</h4>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;color:black;font-family:sans-serif;"> 
Our mission today is to bring maimai to those who have gone through a similar story as me, those who don't have the game in their area, or those that want to get practice at home.
<br>
This is the reason why the site motto is what it is. We bring the arcade games of Japan over the blue horizon (departing Japan, far away) and back (returning). 
<br>
GetzeAvenue and I established the community just for this exact purpose. maimai is a rhythm game where you feel the beat with the palm of your hands. With a large 
<br>
variety of Japanese songs in various genres, it is fit for lovers of the Japanese culture, anime fans, or even the average gamer. There is a song for everyone on maimai.
<br>
When Emuline shut down mysteriously early this year, everything vanished. The KRDcade community serves the purpose of being a small forum for others to install maimai,
<br>
and to be a casual rhythm gaming community. That is why GetzeAvenue and I invite you to KRDcade, so you can Clean Up All Stereotypes (quoted from the 1st gen maimai cabs) 
<br>
and feel the beat with other people who enjoy this game!</p>
