            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>KRDcade is primarily a discord server created to assist people with setting up maimai on their home PCs. Over time some members found interest in other games and there was a notice in the difficulty in setting up such games or even finding working links to download them from. With this website, we intend to provide easy access to working downloads for arcade rhythm games as well as various guides on how to setup your games to play. We mainly provide support for maimai's various versions but have also found interest in attempting to run other games with the majority being a success. Please bear in mind this website is a work in progress and is currently being tested. No links will be added at this time.</p>
